Thank you for the interest in 'bankdetails' repository.

I've designed the test as web enterprise application using Spring, Hibernate, 
JPA, RESTful and Maven. Infact, it is possible to use the application with the
browser, via a RESTful and an HTTP Invoker client, so that to have the possibility
to manage the 'credit cards' manually or via a .csv  file. To run the application
using the file script 'bankdetails.sh' contained in the source package, you'll also
find here an example of .csv file to load some new 'credit cards'. 
The address to access the application is 'http://localhost:8080/bankdetails'
instead, the account and password to access the RESTful service using the browser
is 'remote' 'remote'. In the package 'org.frusso.bankdetails.client' there are two 
examples of client: one based on RESTful and one based on Spring HTTP Invoker template.

Kind Regards,
Francesco
