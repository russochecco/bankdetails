Thank you for the interest in 'bankdetails' repository.

I've designed the test as web enterprise application using Spring, Hibernate, JPA, RESTful and Maven. Infact, it is possible to use the application with the browser, via a RESTful and an HTTP Invoker client, so that to have the possibility to manage the 'credit cards' manually or via a .csv file. To run the application using the file script 'bankdetails.sh' contained in the source package, you'll also find here an example of .csv file to load some new 'credit cards'. The address to access the application is 'http://localhost:8080/bankdetails/list', instead, the account and password to access the RESTful service using the browser is 'remote' 'remote'. In the package 'org.frusso.bankdetails.client' there are two examples of clients implementation: one based on RESTful and one based on Spring HTTP Invoker template. I've developed and tested the application using the follow environment:

Ubuntu Linux 14.0
NetBeans 8.0.2
Java 1.7
Spring 3.1.0
Maven 3.2.1
Jetty pulgin 6.1.14

 
Kind Regards,
Francesco
